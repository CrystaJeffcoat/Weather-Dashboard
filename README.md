# Weather Dashboard

An application that tells you the current weather, and the forecast for the next five days.

Link to [application](https://crystajeffcoat.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/).

## How it works

```
* When the application is deployed 
* The user is shown the forecast for New York, the default city.

* When the user searches a new city, the new citys weather will be displayed and it will be stored below as a recent search.
* When the user clicks on a recently searched city, that cities weather will be displayed.

* The name of the city and current date will be displayed at the top of the page.
* Below that, the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index will also be displayed along with an image of the current weather icon.
* The color of the UV index will change depending on its strength.

* The forecast for the next five days will be displayed under the current weather.
* The forecasts will display the day of the week, the average temp of that day, the humidity, and a weather icon.
